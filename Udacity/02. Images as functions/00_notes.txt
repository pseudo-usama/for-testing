Image can be thought of as mathematical functions
Color images are vector functions
Digital images are discrete functions and have a finite range and domain
While capturing image we do sampling and quantization
For computation images should be converted to float range of [0 1]
Adding/Blending images
Subtracting images (subtraction is order depended)
Adding noise like Gaussian or Normal noise
Noise is just and random function with some specified distribution
We can specify noise magnitude with respect to image range with floating number of range [0 1]
